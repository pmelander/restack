# ReStack

**Residual architecture skills for Claude Code.** A collection of skills built on **Residuality Theory** — designed to build antifragile systems thinking and Solution Architect capabilities that compound over time.

> Formerly *Residual Architecture Skill Set*. Renamed to ReStack in September 2026; the history is unchanged.

> **Philosophy:** Skills are designed to transfer capability to architects, not create dependency on tools. The measure of success is how little you need them.

## Start Your Journey

The first thing to do with any new engagement isn't to open a specific skill — it's to understand where you are and what the terrain demands.

```
/journey start
```

Tell Claude about the system you're working on — what you're trying to achieve, what exists today, and any constraints. It will assess the terrain and map your recommended skill sequence from there.

The journey looks different depending on the terrain:

- **Greenfield** — design paths, walk and stress them, then build what survives
- **Brownfield** — discover what exists before changing anything
- **Minefield** — discover extensively before touching anything

At the heart of every journey is an iteration loop, not a straight line:

```
walk paths → generate stressors → build matrix → find residuals
     ↑                                                  ↓
  re-walk ←← implement residuals ←← impact low enough? ←←
```

You keep iterating until the system's vulnerability is sufficiently low — not zero, but low enough given the aspiration and the cost of further improvement.

## Skills

14 skills spanning the full architectural journey:

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| Orchestration | `/journey` |
| Discovery | `/discover` |
| Stressor Analysis | `/stressor` |
| Design & Documentation | `/adr` `/solution-doc` `/tech-stack` `/design-review` |
| Cloud & Infrastructure | `/cloud` `/capacity` |
| Organisational Capabilities | `/arch-learning` `/capability-assessor` `/patterns` `/evolve` |
| Utilities | `/excel` |

> **Note on Risk and Compliance:** A standalone Risk Assessor and Compliance Checker were deliberately excluded. Residuality Theory covers risk through antifragility thinking (`/stressor`) — risk registers create false confidence in enumerated threats. Compliance is handled through **stressor compliance packs** (`/stressor compliance <pack>`), so regulatory requirements emerge as residues of antifragile design rather than a separate checklist process. See [ADR-006](docs/adr/ADR-006-exclude-risk-assessor-skill.md) and [ADR-007](docs/adr/ADR-007-compliance-via-stressor-packs.md).
